- Mouse pressed: If mouse presses lit up boxes in the right order, they'll score a point. 

Score count will be in the corner. Mouse movement will not be tracked, but whether the mouse presses the buttons will be tracked. If they're in the right order, the user will score a point. If not, then they lose a life and lose a certain number of points. Once they lose all lives, they must restart the game. Their end screen will show their score.
